# ComputerNetworks
In this assignment, we were tasked with implementing error detection mechanisms, such as CRC-8, CRC-16, 2D Parity, and Checksum, for a given set of data. The goal of the assignment is to demonstrate your understanding of these error detection techniques and their practical application.
